<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Teacher reference number</h1>

<p>If you don’t know what your teacher reference number (TRN) is, this can usually be found on your payslip, teachers’ pension documentation or teacher training records.</p>

<p>The TRN is typically seven digits long, but previously has been known as a QTS, GTC, DfE, DfES or DCSF number and therefore may include the letters RP and the forward slash symbol ‘/’. For example: 4567814 or 95/78674</p>

<p>If you cannot find your TRN, you can request a reminder.</p>
