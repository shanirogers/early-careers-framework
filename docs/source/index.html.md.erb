# About

This is the documentation for the Department for Education (DfE)s Continuing
Professional Development API.

## API Status

The API spec is currently in DRAFT and so subject to change. It is being
published to get feedback from external parties.

## What this API is for

Reporting and managing information about continuing professional development.

## Codes and reference data

We avoid proprietary codes wherever possible, preferring existing data formats
such as ISO-certified standards or HESA codes. All dates in the API
specification are intended to be [ISO
8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) compliant

## How do I connect to this API?

### Authentication and authorisation

The Continuing Professional Development API uses Bearer Authentication for
authentication and authorization.

To begin, obtain an access token from [support][1] at
<support-continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk>. Then
your client application sends the token to the API that you want to access.

This page gives an overview of the authorization scenarios that the API
supports, and provides links to more detailed content.

#### Send the access token to an API

After an application obtains an access token, it sends the token with each API
request in an HTTP Authorization request header. It is not possible to send
tokens as URI query-string parameters because URI parameters can end up in log
files that are not completely secure. Also, it is good REST practice to avoid
creating unnecessary URI parameter names.

Access tokens are valid only for the set of operations and resources described
in the scope of the token request. For example, if an access token is issued
only for the Tracking Event API, it does not grant access to the Trainee Details
API. You can, however, send that access token to the Tracking Event API multiple
times for similar operations.

#### Refresh the access token, if necessary

Access tokens have limited lifetimes. If your application needs access to an API
beyond the lifetime of a single access token, you will need to obtain a refresh
token. Again, obtain a new access token from [support][1] at
<support-continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk>.

### Versioning

The version of the API is specified in the URL `/api/v{n}/`. For example:
`/api/v1/`.

When the API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, a new version
number of the API will be published.

When a new version, for example `/api/v2`, is published, both the
previous **v1** and the current **v2** versions will be supported. However we
will only support up-to one version back, so if the **v3** is published, the
**v1** will be discontinued.

When non-breaking changes are made to the API, this will not result in a version
bump. An example of a non-breaking change could be the introduction of a new
field without removing an existing field.

Information about deprecations (for instance attributes/endpoints that will be
modified/removed) will be included in the API response through a ‘Warning’
header.

We will update our [release notes](./release-notes.html) with all breaking
and non-breaking changes.
